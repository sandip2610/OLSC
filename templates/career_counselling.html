    The Career Council is a specialized organization that helps students explore the right career options based on their interests and skills.
      This council assists students in developing professional abilities, building self-confidence, and acquiring
      the capacity to make informed and thoughtful decisions. When students plan their future and set career goals,
      the council provides them with proper guidance to ensure they take the right path.
    <br>
    The members of the council regularly organize workshops, mentoring sessions, and career guidance programs.
      These activities not only enhance studentsâ€™ skills and knowledge but also prepare them to face real-life challenges.
      Students learn about potential careers in various fields such as science, technology, business, social sciences, and arts,
      and they can plan their paths according to their individual abilities.
