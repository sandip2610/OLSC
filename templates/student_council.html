    <p style="color:#555; line-height:1.6; text-align:center;">
    The Student Council is a representative body, elected from among the students to serve the school community.
      It is not merely a formal responsibility but an important platform for developing students’ leadership,
      sense of responsibility, and decision-making abilities. Through the management of various activities and projects in the school,
      the Student Council ensures active participation of the students.
    <br>
    The council members play a vital role in fostering leadership among students. They do not only lead their own teams
      but also ensure coordination and collaboration among students in various school activities. This helps enhance teamwork,
      communication skills, and problem-solving abilities among students. Nearly all major events in the school, such as cultural programs,
      sports competitions, science exhibitions, and social activities, are conducted smoothly with the support of the Student Council.
    <br>
    The members of the Student Council work closely with teachers and the administration. They help ensure compliance with
      school rules and convey students’ needs and concerns to the administration. This serves as a reliable channel for students
      to express any issues or concerns they may have. As a result, the school environment becomes more transparent, friendly, and supportive.    </p>
