    <p style="color:#555; line-height:1.6; text-align:center;">
      Every student is assigned a mentor who provides guidance on academics, personal development, and career planning. Our mentors help students set goals, overcome challenges, and develop essential life skills. This one-on-one support ensures that each student receives attention and encouragement to excel in all areas of life.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#555; line-height:1.6; text-align:center;">
      Mentoring sessions include goal-setting, regular feedback, leadership training, and emotional support to ensure holistic growth of students in a nurturing environment.
